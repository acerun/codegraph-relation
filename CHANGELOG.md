## [Unreleased]


## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- **CodeGraph-powered Architecture**: Replaced the internal LSP client (`LspClient`) and SQLite database (`DatabaseManager`) with a unified `CodeGraphService`. All symbol indexing, search, and relation queries now delegate to the CodeGraph engine, removing ~3000 lines of internal indexing and database code.
- **Simplified Symbol & Relation Models**: `SymbolModel` and `RelationModel` are now thin wrappers around `CodeGraphService`, eliminating redundant caching and LSP orchestration logic.
- **Global Status Bar**: Reworked `GlobalStatusBar` to reflect CodeGraph indexing state and provide clearer progress feedback.
- **Configuration Cleanup**: Removed legacy `shared.enableDatabaseMode`, `shared.indexingBatchSize`, and `shared.database.cacheSizeMB` settings that are no longer applicable under the CodeGraph architecture.

### Added
- **Relation Cache**: Added `relationCache.ts` for short-lived in-memory caching of relation results, reducing repeated queries.
- **Tests**: Added `CodeGraphService.test.ts`, `GlobalStatusBar.test.ts`, and `codegraph.integration.test.ts` for the new service layer.
- **Smoke Script**: Added `scripts/smoke-codegraph-service.js` for quick validation of the CodeGraph integration.

### Removed
- **LSP Client**: Removed `src/shared/services/LspClient.ts` — LSP connections are now managed externally by CodeGraph.
- **Database Manager**: Removed `src/shared/services/DatabaseManager.ts` and `src/shared/db/database.ts` — SQLite indexing is replaced by CodeGraph's internal storage.
- **Internal Indexer**: Removed `src/features/symbol/indexer/indexer.ts` — file watching and batch indexing are handled by CodeGraph.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-31

### Changed
- **Indexing Throughput**: Reduced warm-start sync and full rebuild overhead by tagging queued files with their indexing source and carrying known modification times, which avoids redundant exclusion checks and repeated mtime validation for trusted batches while keeping watcher updates conservative.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Smart Search Focus & Auto-Select**: In Project Mode, using the `Focus Project Search` shortcut (`Ctrl+T`) automatically extracts the word or selection under the cursor and executes an immediate search.

### Changed
- **Optimized File System Watcher**: The background file watcher now rigorously restricts its glob scoping to `shared.includeFiles` and actively skips files caught by `shared.excludeFiles`, reducing unnecessary monitoring overhead.

### Fixed
- **Dynamic Configuration Updates**: The Background Indexer now dynamically recreates file system watchers and reloads cache mapping when `shared.includeFiles` or `shared.excludeFiles` are modified.
- **Filter State on Refresh**: Fixed a bug where refreshing the Symbol Window in Project Mode would drop the user's active symbol kind filters and query all types instead.
- **Webview Synchronization**: Resolved cold-start bug preventing search inputs from focusing or receiving queries upon initial extension load.
  - Implemented a `_messagesQueue` mechanism in `SymbolWebviewProvider` and `RelationWebviewProvider` to buffer incoming messages until the React frontend explicitly signals it is `ready`.
  - Enforced strict execution order by replacing asynchronous `.show()` API calls with standard VS Code `vscode.commands.executeCommand('*.focus')` and explicitly `await`ing their resolution.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-24

### Added
- **Cross-Platform Build**: Added build scripts to automatically download and bundle the correct `ripgrep` binary for the target platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) during packaging.

### Fixed
- **Permissions**: Fixed `ripgrep` permission issues on macOS/Linux by adding a runtime check to ensure the binary is executable (`chmod 755`).
- **Indexing**: Improved file discovery for the Symbol Database. Switched from spawning `ripgrep --files` to using the native `vscode.workspace.findFiles` API. This fixes issues with path resolution in WSL/Remote environments and ensures `.gitignore` is respected consistently.
- **Cross-Platform Paths**: Fixed "File not found" errors in WSL/Remote environments by implementing a robust path handling strategy.
    - Correctly handles `ripgrep` output with mixed separators (Windows `\` vs Linux `/`).
    - Ensures Webview communication uses standard URIs while internal tools use file system paths.
    - Added support for `vscode-context-window` navigation in Remote environments (WSL, SSH, Dev Containers, Codespaces).
    - *Note: While we've implemented support for generic remote environments, we have primarily tested on Windows and WSL. If you encounter issues on other remote platforms (SSH, Containers), please file an issue.*

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-21

### Added
- **Relation Window**: Fully implemented the Relation Window for exploring Call Hierarchy.
    - **Incoming/Outgoing Calls**: View callers and callees for the selected symbol.
    - **Both Directions**: Added `relationWindow.showBothDirections` setting to display both incoming and outgoing calls simultaneously.
    - **Deep Search**: Integrated `ripgrep`-based Deep Search for relations to find calls even when LSP is incomplete (e.g., in C/C++ projects).
    - **Filtering**: Filter relation results by symbol kind (e.g., show only Functions or Methods).
    - **Settings**: Added options to "Remove Duplicates" and "Show Definition Path".
- **Reference Window**: Added a dedicated window for looking up references.
    - **Code Preview**: View code context for each reference directly in the list.
    - **Navigation**: Quick jump to reference locations.
- **Symbol Window**:
    - **Split View**: Added `symbolWindow.splitView` setting to separate "Current Document" and "Project Workspace" into two distinct views for simultaneous access.
    - **Kind Filtering**: Added a new filter button to the search bar allowing users to filter symbols by type (Class, Method, Variable, etc.).
    - **Keyword Highlighting**: Search results now highlight the matching query terms for better visibility.
- **Symbol Parsing**: Implemented an extensible `SymbolParser` interface.
    - **C/C++ Support**: Added a specialized parser for C/C++ to strip function signatures and type suffixes for cleaner display.
    - **Auto Detection**: Default `auto` mode selects the appropriate parser based on language ID.
- **New Commands**:
    - **Relation**: `Toggle Direction`, `Manual Search` (Shift+Alt+H), `Lookup References` (Shift+Alt+F12), `Jump to Definition`.
    - **Reference**: `Next Reference` (F2), `Previous Reference` (F1).
    - **Symbol**: `Toggle Mode`, `Focus Project Search` (Ctrl+T), `Focus Current Search` (Ctrl+Shift+O).
- **New Configurations**:
    - `symbolWindow.symbolParsing.mode`: Configure parsing strategy (`auto`, `c-style`, `default`).
    - `symbolWindow.enableHighlighting`: Toggle search result highlighting.
    - `relationWindow.autoSearch`: Automatically search relations on cursor move.
    - `relationWindow.autoExpandBothDirections`: Auto-expand nodes when showing both directions.
    - `relationWindow.enableDeepSearch`: Enable/disable Deep Search for relations.

### Changed
- **Configuration Scope**: Moved several settings to the `shared` scope to reflect their usage across multiple windows (Symbol, Relation, Reference).
    - `symbolWindow.enableDatabaseMode` -> `shared.enableDatabaseMode`
    - `symbolWindow.indexingBatchSize` -> `shared.indexingBatchSize`
    - `symbolWindow.includeFiles` -> `shared.includeFiles`
    - `symbolWindow.excludeFiles` -> `shared.excludeFiles`
    - `shared.database.cacheSizeMB` (New shared setting)

### Refactor
- **Architecture**: Adopted a **Feature-based Architecture**. Source code is now organized into `src/features/{symbol, relation, reference}` for better modularity and maintainability.
- **Shared Core**: Extracted `LspClient` and `DatabaseManager` to `src/shared/core`. This centralizes the LSP connection and SQLite database management.
- **Global Status Bar**: Refactored status bar logic into a shared component (`GlobalStatusBar`).

### Fixed
- **Indexing Stability**: Improved robustness of the background indexer.
    - **Retry Mechanism**: Added automatic retries for files that fail to index (e.g., due to file locks).
    - **Error Handling**: Enhanced handling of file system errors (e.g., `ENOENT`) during indexing to prevent crashes.

### UI/UX
- **Container**: Renamed the main Activity Bar container from "Symbol Window" to **"Window"**. This provides a neutral parent container for both the Symbol and Relation views.
- **Foolproof View**: Introduced a "Foolproof" view (`all-disabled-view`) that activates when both `symbolWindow.enable` and `relationWindow.enable` are set to `false`. It displays a clean interface with buttons to easily re-enable either window.
- **Zap Indicator**: Added `$(zap)` icon to indicate results found via Deep Search (Text Search) vs LSP.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-11-27

### Fixed
- **Incremental Indexing**: Fixed a critical bug where files with 0 symbols were ignored by the indexer, causing them to be re-scanned infinitely during incremental updates.
- **Race Condition Handling**: Added robust existence checks (`fs.stat`) before processing files in the indexing queue. This prevents `ENOENT` errors caused by atomic save operations (delete-then-rename) when using `FileSystemWatcher`.

### Changed
- **Performance Tuning**: 
    - Reduced default `symbolWindow.indexingBatchSize` from 30 to **15** to further reduce LSP load.
    - Increased batch processing delay from 50ms to **100ms** to give the CPU more breathing room between batches.
    - **Data Transfer**: Optimized `loadMore` to use incremental data transfer, reducing IPC overhead when scrolling through large result lists.
- **Configuration**: 
    - `symbolWindow.indexingBatchSize`: Added a hard limit of 200 files/batch to prevent LSP crashes.
    - `symbolWindow.excludeFiles`: Added new setting to control which files are excluded from indexing. Default value now covers a comprehensive list of binary files, images, archives, and documentation (e.g., `.md`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.zip`, `.exe`) to prevent them from being indexed.
    - `symbolWindow.includeFiles`: Added new setting to whitelist specific file patterns for indexing.

### Removed
- **Deep Search**: Removed `symbolWindow.enableDeepSearch` configuration. Deep Search is now an integrated fallback feature in Project Mode (when Database Mode is not ready) and Relation Window, rather than a globally toggled setting.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-11-26

### Added
- **Configuration**: 
    - `symbolWindow.indexingBatchSize`: Configure indexing performance (Default: 30 files/batch). Set to `0` for unlimited speed.
- **Commands**:
    - `Rebuild Symbol Index (Incremental)`: Safely updates the index for changed files.
    - `Rebuild Symbol Index (Full)`: Completely clears and rebuilds the database.

### Fixed
- **State Persistence**: Fixed an issue where the "Database Mode" UI state and Indexing Progress bar would be lost when switching views or reloading the window.
- **Progress Tracking**: Indexing progress is now robustly synced between the backend and the webview.

### Removed
- **Dev Commands**: Removed `symbol-window.testSqlite` and `symbol-window.focus` as they are no longer needed.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-26

### Added
- **Database Mode**: A new high-performance mode backed by SQLite for instant symbol search in large workspaces.
    - **Persistent Index**: Symbols are indexed once and persisted to disk, eliminating wait times on startup.
    - **Incremental Updates**: The index is automatically updated in the background as you edit files.
    - **Hybrid Search**: Combines database speed with LSP accuracy.
- **Configuration**: 
    - `symbolWindow.enableDatabaseMode`: Enable the new SQLite-based mode.
- **UI**: Added a distinct **PROJECT WORKSPACE (DATABASE)** label when Database Mode is active.

### Changed
- **Performance**: Significantly reduced memory usage and improved search responsiveness in large projects when using Database Mode.
- **Documentation**: Updated README and SPEC to reflect the new architecture.

## [0.0.4] - 2025-11-25

### Changed
- **Deep Search Graduation**: Deep Search is no longer experimental and is now enabled by default (`symbolWindow.enableDeepSearch` defaults to `true`).
- **Deep Search Optimization**: Implemented Regex Permutations for multi-keyword matching to significantly improve search speed with `ripgrep`.
- **UI Polish**: Updated the Search Details UI to match VS Code's native design (transparent backgrounds, better spacing).
- **UX Improvements**:
    - Deep Search results are now collapsed by default to reduce clutter.
    - Added `Esc` key support to clear the "Files to Include" input.
    - The "Search Details" toggle is now only visible when Deep Search is enabled.

### Added
- **Advanced Deep Search Filtering**:
    - **Search Scope**: Users can now limit Deep Search to specific folders.
    - **Files to Include**: Added support for glob patterns (e.g., `*.ts`, `src/**`) to filter search results.
- **Search Details Panel**: A new toggleable panel in the search bar (Project Mode) to access advanced filtering options.
- **State Persistence**: The extension now remembers the Search Scope, Include Patterns, and Details Panel visibility across sessions.

## [0.0.2] - 2025-11-24

### Added
- **Deep Search**: A new hybrid search mechanism combining Ripgrep (text scan) and LSP (symbol parsing) to find symbols in large projects where standard LSP results are truncated.
- **Deep Search UI**: Added a "Deep Search" button in Project Mode that appears when results might be incomplete.
- **Result Highlighting**: Deep Search results are highlighted to distinguish them from standard search results.

### Changed
- **Search Logic**: Improved deduplication logic using `selectionRange` to better merge Document and Workspace symbols.
- **UI Feedback**: Enhanced loading state indicators during search operations.

## [0.0.1] - 2025-11-23

### Features
- **Current Document Mode**: Tree view of symbols in the active file with real-time filtering.
- **Project Workspace Mode**: Global symbol search with multi-keyword support.
- **Readiness State Machine**: Robust handling of Language Server initialization and timeouts.
- **LSP Crash Recovery**: Automatic detection and recovery from Language Server failures.
- **Native UI**: Built with VS Code Webview UI Toolkit for a seamless look and feel.
- **Performance**: Implemented caching and debouncing for search queries.
